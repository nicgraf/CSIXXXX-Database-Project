# CSI2132-Database-Project
Hello! This project was for a class called Databases I (CSI2132) and it involved creating both the front end website and back end code for a hotel management and searching service.

It's not super relevant to the field I would like to work in one day, bioinformatics and genomics, but I think it gives a good idea as to my formal training in coding and database management systems. I also coded this project completely on my own having to teach myself a lot, so I think it paints a good picture to what I can learn and am capable of.

There's essentially 3 parts:

The front end HTML jsp files that code for what the website looks like, as well as containing Java scriptlets that communicate with the back end
Back end supporting java code for the scriptlets
SQL code that initialized the database tables, as well as the views, triggers, and indices
This code used Apache Tomcat to run the server on, and I think that's the only plug in used.
